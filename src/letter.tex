I have been working with mobile apps since I graduated from the Systems Science program at
Gothenburg University, and have had the chance to try out different technologies and ways 
of working. My main platform is iOS and I am very passionate about the overall development 
of the platform, its languages and Xcode. My experiences consist of both building new apps 
from the beginning as well as maintaining and performing incremental development of already
existing apps. It has involved working both with Objective C and Swift of different versions. 
I also have experience of cross-platform development with Xamarin.

I truly enjoy working together as a team, solving problems and making robust, good and
performant software. I guess I am a typical developer in the sense that I really like 
to build as efficient and well-structured code as I can. But I really do feel that coding 
is teamwork and that you should always discuss and look for a second opinion regarding your solutions. 
Both to make better results but also to learn.

At my current employer I have mostly been working for a large client here in Gothenburg from 
the industrial sector, which has a lot of different types of apps, most of them for internal use. 
Currently I am involved in a project consisting of four different teams of about 7-10 people each, 
working on a new and exiting solution. In this project I get not only to work with iOS apps 
but also with backend and API development in Golang with AWS infrastructure.

Also I have a hobby-project that I have been working on during spare time that is available 
on the Swedish iOS App Store. In this app I am using an open API from Västtrafik, Gothenburg’s public 
transport provider, to build an app that is – in my opinion – a very useful complement to the 
existing official app where you can subscribe and track your most commonly used stops and departures. 
It is written in Swift and also includes a home-screen widget and an Apple Watch version. Find 
the app by searching for “Nästa Resa” on the App Store.

Apart from software development I enjoy playing golf, following the Biathlon world cup, 
hanging out with friends and my girlfriend, solving Escape Rooms, running, finance and stocks, 
the Way out West festival, eating good food and reading the news. I see myself as a diplomatic 
and easy going person who likes to have a good time as well as being serious about my work and 
I feel very strongly for the tasks that I am involved in.

If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask them. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

Pontus Nilsson Tengnäs
